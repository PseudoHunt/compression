Let:
- N: number of weights in the layer
- L: number of quantization bins (e.g., L = 4 for 2-bit quantization)
- w_i: i-th weight in the layer (i ∈ {1, ..., N})
- q_j: j-th quantization bin value (j ∈ {1, ..., L})
- T: softmax temperature
- P_{ij}: soft assignment probability of w_i to bin q_j
- μ_j: total mass assigned to bin j
